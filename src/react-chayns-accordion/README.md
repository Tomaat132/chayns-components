# Accordion-Component #

The Accordion-Component is part of the *chayns-components* package. It can be installed via npm:

    npm install -S chayns-components@latest

The Accordion-Component hides(actually removes) all child elements when it gets closed and makes the webpage faster. This gets very useful if many elements are stored in the accordion or if there are even wrapped accordions.


## Usage ##

At first the component has to be imported:

```jsx harmony
import { Accordion } from 'chayns-components';
```

Then it can be used like in the following:

```jsx harmony
<Accordion head="Hello">
    <div className="accordion__content">
        Hello World!
    </div>
</Accordion>
```

If you want to make an element and its children non-clickable, you simply have to add the class ``accordion--no-trigger`` to it.

## Props ##
