The preselectedReceivers for the input can be set with the `preselectedReceivers` property. The value must be given
in the following syntax:
```javascript
   const preselectedReceivers = [{
        userId: 1124187,
        name: 'Jannik Weise'
    }, {
        locationId: 81445,
        name: 'Application Team DEV'
    }, {
        groupId: 1,
        name: 'chaynsÂ® Manager',
        includedUsers: ['1124187', '...'] // userIds of persons in group
    }];
```

functions can be used:

| **Function**              | **Description**                                                    |
