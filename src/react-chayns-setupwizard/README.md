# SetupWizard #

The **SetupWizard** - Component is part of the **chayns-components** package. You can install the whole package with the following statement:

    npm install -S chayns-components@latest


## Usage ##

The **SetupWizard** is usually used for setting up Tapps for the first time. My suggestion would be to create the Setup Wizard in the first component, which get rendered into the DOM. This allows you to difference between a normal site view and a setup and also allows you to render the normal view after finishing the setup.
For rendering the **SetupWizard** you have to import *SetupWizard* as well as *SetupWizardItem*.

```jsx harmony
import {SetupWizardItem, SetupWizard} from 'chayns-components';
```

The basic structure of the component will be the following:
```jsx harmony
<SetupWizard ready={()=>{}}>
    <SetupWizardItem title="First">
        <FirstSetup/>
    </SetupWizardItem>
    <SetupWizardItem title="Second">
        <SecondSetup/>
    </SetupWizardItem>
    <SetupWizardItem title="Third">
        <ThirdSetup/>
    </SetupWizardItem>
</SetupWizard>
```

There are 3 different methods for changing the current step, one method for completing the current step and one method to reset the wizard. You can access them in the Step-Components (for example FirstSetup, SecondSetup,...) through the context:
```jsx harmony
 static contextTypes = {
     stepComplete: PropTypes.func,
     nextStep: PropTypes.func,
     previousStep: PropTypes.func,
     toStep: PropTypes.func,
     resetToStep: PropTypes.func
 };
```
 **Important:** `previousStep` and `toStep` are deprecated according to the design guide.

 **Note:** You have to call stepComplete with a boolean parameter for completing/not completing the current step.
